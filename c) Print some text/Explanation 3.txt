* In C program, except main( ) function, Coder can use Functions in two ways:
1. Custom or user build Function
2. Built-in Standard Library Function

*The built-in Standard Library contains functions to perform disk I/O (input/output),
String manipulations, mathematical computations, and much more.
Library functions can be enhanced and expanded as needed to accomodate changing circumstances.


*To use a Library Function in C Program; it is needed to add Header File.
Header File has .h or .H extention.

Header File contains all information about the Standard Library Functions in various files.

A C_Program_Compiler uses the information in these files to handle the Library functions properly.

*How to add header file:
        #include Preprocessor_Directive
All C_Program_Compilers use as their 1st phase of compilation a Preprocessor, which performs various 
manipulations on Source code/File before it is compiled.
Preprocessor_Directives are not actually part of the C_Language, but rather instructions from 
Programmer/Codder to the Compiler.
The #include directive tells the preprocessor to read in another file and include it with coder's program.
Note: #include directive does not end with a semicolon (;)


*How to print in output terminal : a word/words/sentance
answer: using Library function: printf()

printf( ) is C's general purpose output function.

*printf structure:   printf(Function Argument)
    function argument--> input in function : String_to_output

* String--> one or more Characters enclosed between double Quotes(")
eg, 'c', "word", "my name is kundu"

* which header file is neededfor printf( )?
answer: standard(std) input(i) output(o) [stdio] header file

* how to use this in C Program?
answer:
        one way:   #include<stdio.h>      --> traditional
      another way:   #include<STDIO.H>    -->  not Traditional


*Codes:

code1:
/* print some text */
//header file adding - lower-case letters
#include <stdio.h>

//main function
int main(void)
{
    //printf function statement
    printf("this is a string\n");
    
    return 0;
}

code2:
/* print some text */
//header file adding - upper-case letters
#include <STDIO.H>

//main function
int main(void)
{
    //printf function statement
    printf("this is a string\n");
    
    return 0;
}
