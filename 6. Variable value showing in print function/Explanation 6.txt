* how to show any variable value>
answer: using Format Specifier in printf( ) fuction

* Format Specifier or Format Code informs printf( ) [output displaying function ] or 
scanf() [ input taking function ]
that a different type item is to be displayed or taken.
The Value associated with a format code is displayed at the point where that format code is encountered 
in the String.

*formate specifiers types:
data type                      printf( )                scanf( ) 
character                      %c                       %c
integer / decimal              %d or %i                       %d
floating point                 %f                       %f
double                         %f                       %lf [ only difference ]

* basic Backlash constants of printf( ) function:
new line or line braek --> \n  [prints 2nd line as a sperate from 1st line]

for example: 
            printf("this is 1st line\n");
            printf("this is 2nd line");
    output--> print 2 lines on screen as 2 lines


horizontal Tab --> \t   [prints 2nd line or word or letter form 1st line using a Tab spearation ]

for example: 
            printf("this is 1st line\t");
            printf("this is 2nd line");
    output--> print 2 lines on screen in one line but there is a a tab gap betwwen them.

*codes:
code1:
/*printf( )'s basic backlash constants*/
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    /*new line application*/
    printf("this is 1st line\n");
    printf("this is 2nd line");

    printf("\n");

    /*new tab application*/
    printf("this is 1st line\t");
    printf("this is 2nd line");

    return 0;
}


code2:
/*printing variable value*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    /* variable value declare*/
    char c = 'D'; int a = 23;
    float b = 109.325;  double f = 3142536.34453636366788;
    //printing all
    printf("This is character value: "); printf("%c\n", c);
    printf("This is integer value: "); printf("%d\t", a); printf("%i\n", a);
    printf("This is floating value: "); printf("%f\n", b);
    printf("This is double value: "); printf("%f", f);

    return 0;
}
