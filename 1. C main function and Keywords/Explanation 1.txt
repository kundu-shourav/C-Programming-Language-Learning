* A C Program file has an extension of .c

* All c programs consists of one or more functions, where function(s) contain(s)  one or more statements.

* A statement or Statements are the part of C program taht actually perform operations. A Statement specifies an action 
to be performed by the C Program.
All C Program's Statements end with a semicolon (;)
for example:  return 0;  
C Program does not recognize the end of the line as a terminator. This means there are no constraints on the position of 
Statementsn within a Line.
Also, Anyone may place two or more Staements on one line.
for example: int x; printf("hello world");

* Function Machanism:

     putting input   ---->     input  processing      --->  return output

* Function and Data Types:

1. interger or decimal data [ number ] ( having no decimal or floating point ) :  2 , 207, 10000, 0, 
   integer or decimal functions gives or return an interger/decimal data

2. floating point data [ number ] ( having decimal point ) : 2.4 , 107.2244
   floating point functions gives or return an floating point number

3. charecter data [ letter/alphabet ] : c, e, f
   charecter data functions gives or return a charecter data

4. String data [ series of letters/alphabets or Words or sentence ] : cool, eat, foolish people can do anything
   String data functions gives or return a String data

5. void data [ nothing or empty ] : 
   void  data functions gives or return a void data

* Function Structure:
   
  Return_Data_Type Function_Name ( Parameter_list )
  {
    Statement 1;
    Statement 2;
  }

if a function does not use parameters, then its parameter list should be contain the keyword void.

* The only Function that C Program must have is Main Function [ main( ) ]. 
The main function [ main ( ) ] is where execution of C Program begins. That is , when any C Program begins running, 
it starts executing the statements inside
Main function beginning with the 1st Statement after the Openning Curly Brace [ { ]. C Program ends 
when Main function's Closing Curly Brace is reached [ } ].

* Main function can be two types: either interger/decimal (int) or void 

1. void main ( ) returns nothing. so, its parameter list should be contain the keyword void.  
The Void tells the compiller that main( ) does not have any parameters.
Hence, there is no statement inside of this.
void main can be expressed :
 i) void main(void)   ---> standard way    ii) void main( )    ---> common way

2. int main ( ) returns an interger value and that is 0. : retrun 0;  --> this is the unchanged statement.
By convention, a return value of zero( 0 ) from main( ) indicates normal program termination. 
Any other value represents an Error : return 12; --> this is error statement.
int main can be expressed in two ways:
 i) int main(void)   ---> standard way   ii) int main( )    ---> common way

Note: int main(void) or int main( ) is recommented

* Keywords:
the statement-->  return 0;
in this statement, 'return' word is a Keyword. ANSI C Standard has total 32 Keywords that may not be used 
as Function or Variable name.
these are: 
auto       else       register     typedef
break      enum       return       union
case       extern     short        unsigned
char       float      signed       void
continue   goto       sizeof       volatile
default    if         static       while
do         int        struct       double
long       switch

* Many C Compilers have added several additional kwywords that are used to take better advantages of the environment 
in which the compiler is used and that give support for inrerlanguage programming, interrupts, and memory organizations.
