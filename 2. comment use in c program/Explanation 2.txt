* A Comment is a note to Coder that Coder puts into Source Code.
All Comments are ignored by the Compilers.
Comments are used primarily to document the meaning and purpose of coder's source code, 
so that coder can remenber later how it functions and how to use it.


* Comments are two kinds:
1. Single Line Comment by C++ compiler
       // this is single line comment
   
2. ANCI C comment:  /*       */
    i) single line Comment:   /* this is single line comment */
    ii) Multi-line Comment:  
        /*  this is
          multi-line
           comment */

* Note: 
In C program, a Comment can go anywhere except in the middle of any C Keyword, 
Function name or variable name.
error-->  re/* My name is Mr. bey */turn 0;
error-->  int X/* Hi World! */_y ( );
error-->  char  My/* Hello */_Name;

Comments may not be nested.
error-->  /* Hello /* My sister */ world*/


*Codes:

code1: no error
// this is a single line comment
/* this is another single line comment */

int main(void)
{
    /* this is
    multi-line
    comment */

    return 0;
}


code2: has error
/ this is a single line comment
/* this is another single line comment 

int main(void)
{
     this is
    multi-line
    comment */

    return 0;
}


code3: has error
/ this is a single line comment
/* this is another single line comment 

int m/*A comment*/ain(void)
{
     this is
    multi-line
    comment */
    
    //variable declaration
    int vari/* a comment*/able_1;

    re/* a comment*/turn 0;
}
